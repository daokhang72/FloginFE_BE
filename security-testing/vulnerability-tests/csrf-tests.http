### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Tests

# Note: Since this app uses JWT tokens (stateless), CSRF protection is less critical
# CSRF mainly affects session-based authentication
# These tests verify proper authentication is required

# Test 1: Attempt to Create Product Without Token (CSRF simulation)
POST http://localhost:8080/api/products
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "CSRF Test Product",
  "description": "This should fail without token",
  "price": 100,
  "quantity": 10,
  "categoryId": 1
}

###

# Test 2: Attempt to Update Product Without Token
PUT http://localhost:8080/api/products/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Updated via CSRF",
  "price": 999
}

###

# Test 3: Attempt to Delete Product Without Token
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/products/1

###

# Test 4: Attempt State-Changing Operation with GET (should not be allowed)
GET http://localhost:8080/api/products/delete/1

###

# Test 5: Cross-Origin Request Without CORS
POST http://localhost:8080/api/products
Content-Type: application/json
Origin: http://evil.com

{
  "name": "Evil Product",
  "price": 100
}

###

# Test 6: Verify CORS Headers
OPTIONS http://localhost:8080/api/products
Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization

###

# Expected Results:
# - Requests without valid JWT token should return 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden
# - State-changing operations should only work with POST/PUT/DELETE (not GET)
# - CORS should only allow configured origins
# - OPTIONS request should return proper CORS headers
